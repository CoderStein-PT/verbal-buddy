Create any categories of words so later you can:
- Practice your knowledge of the words from the category **without looking at them.**
- Practice **guessing the words** from categories by their properties.
- **Creating jokes** using two or more words by making associations between them.

Over time you:
- Stop forgetting words when talking.
- Improve your communication skills.
- Improve your memory and ability to create associations between words.
- Express yourself better.
- Become more confident (Yes, that's right).

It's a great tool for:
- Introverted people.
- The ones who want to learn a new language / terminology / words.

To speed up learning:
- Use speech recognition features **(microphone icon below).**
- Use voice feedback **(text to speech).**

You can configure both in the [Settings](/settings) page.
