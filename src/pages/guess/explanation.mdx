## Guess

Guess the words by looking at their descriptions! 🔥

---

- You don't need to press Enter to check if the word is correct. If it is - **it will be automatically submitted.**
- For speed, you can type the word **without spaces, dashes and capital letters.** For example, **"The Great Gatsby"** can be typed as **"thegreatgatsby".**
- You'll see the stats on the right after you guess all the words. **Avg.** is the most important metric as it shows how much time you think between each word on average. Your goal is to improve it over time.
- The timer counts only the time you spend thinking about the words, not the time you spend typing them. The red dot indicates that the timer is paused.
