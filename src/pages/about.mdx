<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

There are many different reasons why you are struggling with communication but one of them might be:

**You simply don't use your speaking language enough.**

You sit all day long in front of your computer and don't talk to anyone.

You're not accessing the part of your 🧠 responsible for human communication *(if you're a hardcore computer programmer, for instance)*
so it kinda atrophies as the time goes by and you lose the ability to communicate well.

Your main language becomes Python or JavaScript.

You even become good at it. But guess what are you becoming bad at?

Human communication.

<h3 className="text-center" >And that's not trivial!</h3>

It's a crucial skill as all success in our modern world is based on human communication - **from making friends and getting a job to building skyscrapers and achieving our highest dreams.**

It's no wonder that people who aren't super-smart but good at communicating **feel more fulfilled, confident and relaxed in life** than those who are smart but lack communication skills **(just look around you!).**

Your confidence is low because:
	- You know that you're likely to mumble / stutter / forget words in any next social situations.
	- And in situations when your life depends on what you will say *(like a job interview, presentation, sales, relationships, etc.)* and everything moves quickly, you'll just freeze or say something stupid.
	- In negotiations/conflicts instead of thinking more about the solution, you focus on remembering **the words/phrases all the time** and the person who thinks more about the solution **has much more leverage and advantage.**
	- So the odds are always against you and you feel like you're not in control of your life.
	- You start avoiding those situations altogether and feel less confident.
	- And because of that you might feel anxious, depressed, lonely, etc.

So it's a vicious cycle...

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

**Gladly it's a skill that can be learned and improved!**

To improve you want to:
	- Have instant access to words in your brain at any time
	- Collect those words into grammatically correct sentences (otherwise you'll fail to deliver your message even if you know the words perfectly well) without thinking about how to do it too much
	- Express them well, without mumbling or stuttering (which is a different topic - voice, but still important to mention here)

That might be already enough for you to:
	- **Have more control over your relationships and life**
	- Keep up with the tempo of conversations and **not feel left out**
	- Speak **with confidence** that the next thing you're going to say will come out effortlessly, will sound right and make sense instead of being anxious, putting your body in a defensive mode and freezing up
	- Make others hear your ideas and actually make a difference instead of being a bystander
	- Make friends easier and have **deeper and more fulfilling** relationships
	- Focusing on the **solutions** instead of the words / how to say it and thus having more leverage in negotiations/conflicts/difficult situations
	- Be less anxious, more confident and relaxed **as a result**
	- Get a job/promotion/open a business/raise money/hire people etc.
	- Feel respected by other people since you get your ideas across
	- Not have awkward silences anymore
	- **Actually having fun**

---

But there is a deeper level where you can practice:
	- Describing objects/ideas/feelings/life and finding relations between them quickly.
	- Having quicker brain access to your thoughts and bigger ideas by deloping your verbal creativity and imagination.

Which allows you to:
	- Be easily funny when it's needed or wanted
	- Be creative and tell captivating stories
	- Be a good speaker, presenter, negotiator, leader, teacher etc.

Which multiplies the basic level effects by a lot.

Others benefit too - not just you! **Don't you want to make the world a better place?** 🙂

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works?</h2>

Reading books and watching movies **isn't enough!** You need to create.

**You need to be the one who is expressing - not just consuming.**

Just hanging out with your friends or partying also isn't enough - you spend a lot of time waiting and listening to others instead of actually improving.

You need to **proactively(!)** practice accessing the words/phrases/sentences in your brain and strengthen the [neural pathways](https://www.greatmindsclinic.co.uk/blog/what-are-neural-pathways/) leading to them so you always have them at your fingertips to use in any situation.

<h2 id="how-to-use-the-app">How to use the app?</h2>

This app provides a few tools to help you practice - but doesn't do it for you (it's supposed to be like that since being **proactive** is the main priority here).

You have to type a lot of the times, but that's not a bug - **it's a feature.** That's also why it's not a mobile app. That's also why we don't provide hints or auto-complete.

**The goal is to develop your brain - not learn how to use another tool, right?** 🤓

So there are a few sections:

<h3 id="content"> 1. Content</h3>
Here you create a list of categories and words you want to learn. You have a few presets in [the settings](/settings) to get you started. But it's also a good idea to create your own lists.

- To create your own content just think of any category of things in life *(like food, travel, work, relationships, hobbies, feelings, body, animals, cities, etc.)* and create it here.
- Then think of words/phrases that belong to that category and add them to it.
- Don't rush - **you can always come back** and add more words/categories later.
- Now go back to categories and **click on the "practice" button** next to the category you want to practice. You'll have to fill in a certain amount of words you remember as fast as you can.
- When you finish the results will get saved to the statistics section. You'll have to improve the time you spend thinking about the words (Average Delay time) which is what usually matters the most and must be a good metric to measure your progress.
- You can also add properties to words which is also a good practice by itself. It will help you think deeper about the words and their relations and develop creativity.
- You can relate words to each other (for instance "dog" is a "pet").
- You can hear the pronunciation of the words. Make sure to use the [settings](/settings) to set the language you want to practice.
- You also can create the opposites of words (for instance "sun" -> "moon"). This will be useful in the "Jokes" section below as one of the components of humor is [irony](https://www.baconsports.com/11-funny-filters-to-write-funnier-jokes/).

<h3 id="guess"> 2. Guess</h3>

Here you can practice guessing words/phrases from their properties from the categories you created.

<h3 id="jokes"> 3. Jokes</h3>
In this section you can practice jokes by using a method called "analogy" with the words you created in the "Content" section.

For instance:

> What do you call a cow with no legs?
> 
> Ground beef.

What makes people laugh is when you make a connection between two things that are not usually connected.

To make those kinds of jokes you take two words and list their properties:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Cow</th>
      <th>Ground Beef</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Animal</td>
      <td>Meat</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Has legs</td>
      <td>Has no legs</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Is big</td>
      <td>Ground (land)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Moo</td>
      <td>Beef (cow)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

You can create a joke by connecting the two words in a way that makes logical sense and **creates surprise in the end**.

You can create even more complex jokes by connecting more than two words or by simply improvising and writing more.

<h3 id="journal"> 5. Journal</h3>

Here you can write down your thoughts and ideas.

It's a good practice because it organizes your mind.

You can erase the whole journal whenever you want.

<h3 id="settings"> 4. Settings</h3>

Here you can:
- Change the basic settings of the app.
- Apply or add new presets.

<h2 id="learn-faster"> Tips to Learn Faster 🚀</h2>

To learn faster you can use the following features:
- **Speech recognition.** It's not perfect on some devices, but it's a good feature to use when you're practicing.
- **The "Speak" button** to hear the pronunciation of the words/categories.
- **Hear the definitions** when guessing words.

All those things are configurable in the [settings](/settings).

<h2 id="how-long">How much time will it take?</h2>

It's a tool to help you practice, not a magic pill that will make you a genius in a week.
Try to be consistent and practice frequently.

Don't get discouraged if you don't see results immediately - it's a skill that takes time to develop.

<h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>

Feel free to use the app creatively and inappropriately because:

- We don't store any of your data on our servers.
- Everything you put in (content, words, definitions, jokes, etc.) is stored in your browser's local storage and is accessible only by you. We don't have access to it.
- We don't have a database.

Later we might implement some way to enable accounts or multiplayer, but that's not the main goal of the app for now.

---

We use only [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) for speech recognition and speech synthesis that is available in most modern browsers.

If you decide to use speech recognition on our website you should know that the speech recognition is done by your browser and/or drivers and/or devices you have on your computer and we don't have responsibility for what those do with the data you record using them. We don't store nor process any of that data.
