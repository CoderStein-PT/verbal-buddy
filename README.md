  Verbal Buddy
</h1>

<p align="center" >Web app to help shy people develop communication skills and express <br/>themselves so they become more talkative, confident, relaxed, social and successful.<br/><br/>Open-source, doesn't collect user's data.</p>

## How it works?

This app provides different tools you can use to turn the parts of your brain responsible for communication and language so you can:

- Have more control over your relationships and life
- Keep up with the tempo of conversations and not feel left out
- Make others hear your ideas and actually make a difference instead of being a bystander
- Make friends and have deeper and more fulfilling relationships
- Focusing on the solutions instead of the words / how to say them and thus having more leverage in negotiations/conflicts/difficult situations
- Be less anxious, more confident and relaxed as a result
- Get a job/promotion/open a business/raise money/hire people etc. easier.
- Feel respected by other people since you get your ideas across
- Not have awkward silences anymore
- Actually having fun

The tools are:

- Guess words from their descriptions
- Fill as many words you know from certain categories to train your brain to access them
- Practice remembering the words you wrote with a timer ticking so you try to improve your speed
- Describe objects
- Make jokes in a structured and controlled manner

### Privacy

It saves your data only in localStorage.
